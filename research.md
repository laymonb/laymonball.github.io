# Research

My work focuses on:
- The role of pollinator shifts in plant diversification
- Phylogenetic patterns in pollination syndromes
- Ecological niche modeling of flowering plant species

Current projects include:
- Investigating how elevation influences pollinator transitions.
- Using machine learning to predict floral trait evolution.
- Analyzing chloroplast genome variation among Neotropical species.
