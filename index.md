I study the evolution of plant-pollinator interactions, focusing on how ecological, geographical, and phylogenetic factors shape floral diversity. I am currently a PhD candidate at Louisiana State University. My research is supported by a Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) from the National Science Foundation and Gilliam Fellowship award from Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
